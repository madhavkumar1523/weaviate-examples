# Weaviate examples

List of examples and tutorials of how to use the Vector Search Engine
Weaviate for cool machine-learning related tasks.

### Running Weaviate

* Most examples assume you have a Weaviate running. You can run one locally by following [this installation guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/getting-started/installation.html#customize-your-weaviate-setup) in the documentation.
  * If you need a specific vectorizer module or another ML module, it will be explained in the tutorial.
* Basic links: [Documentation](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate) â€“ [Github](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/) - [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/weaviate/shared_invite/zt-goaoifjr-o8FuVz9b1HLzhlUfyfddhw)
